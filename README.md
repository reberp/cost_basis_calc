Did some crypto trading. Not worth paying for anything to give me a form when it's only a few low cost trades.    
Just does FIFO right now for that sweet LTCG. 

* Fun fact: Did taxes recently and the software doesn't just import these forms because the 8949 I guess isn't the right form anyway... Till next year. 

TODO:  
* asset col
* 'convert' trades
* modes (lifo/avg)
* combine docs into single pdf
